Hey {{ user.username }},

We all miss a dose sometimes - it happens to everyone! The important thing is not to get discouraged.

Remember that building healthy habits is a journey with ups and downs. Each new day is an opportunity to start fresh and recommit to your medication routine.

Here are some quick tips that might help:
- Set additional reminders at strategic times
- Keep your medication somewhere visible
- Pair taking your medication with another daily habit
- Ask a friend or family member to help remind you

Your health is what matters most, and we're here to support you every step of the way!

You can do this - we believe in you!
